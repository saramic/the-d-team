You can have the greatest insight, but you need to be able to present it effectively.
The Feltron Report (annual report about himself)
Humanising the data and making it meaningful and accessible.
Goals: Engaging, Informative, Designed.
10 minutes to present, 5 minutes of Q&A on pitch night.

## Engaging:
### Delivering insights to a specific audience: 
1. Judges 
2. The ficticious person who would benefit most from our findings.
--> E.g. regulators, police, pharmacies, pharmaceutical companies, data mining companies
Understand their motivations.
Explicitly mention this persona in the presentation to frame it in the right way.

### Storytelling
1. Time marker, place marker - Tells people it's a story.
2. Characters and dialogue - Humanises the data.
3. Sequence of events - A journey, invites engagement
4. Surprise/unexpected - Often developed first.
5. Don't forget the "so what?!" - Make a point, why is it important (to our audience?)

The story can be from the team's perspective (journey of discovery)
or from the data itself (journey of a patient, pharmacy, ...)

## Charting
datavizcatalogue.com
Mapping is great!
Humanise charts using memorable imagery.

# Design

## Hierarchy
Not all data is of equal importance.
Give the most important number/chart the most space, biggest font.
Surround it by de-emphasised supporting information.
