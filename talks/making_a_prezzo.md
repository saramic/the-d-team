Communicating effectively - Mark Alexander
------------------------------------------

# Content
Dedicate time and effort the report, iterate over it multiple times, and refine it into awesomeness.

## Hypothesis-driven approach
Do the thinking before you do the analysis (but after gaining an overview of the data).
Dive deep after you think so much that your brain hurts, testing a specific hypothesis.

Bringing the insights back to the audience

First screening to be done by Phil and Joost, need to get past them.
The panel only sees the top 5!

Inductive vs deductive
Inductive: tell a story from the bottom up, like a book
Deductive: start with the punchline, then explain it

Use your insight as the title of each slide, not some general blurb!

Decided how you will visualise your insights before doing the analysis.

Kill the fill: keep it clear and simple.

# Delivery

Know your audience, stalk the judges, tailor it to THEM.

Structure:

* Who are you?
  * Give name, role function
* Why am I here?
  * Share objectives, goals
  * Set expectations
  * Review agenda and timeline
* Why is this important to me?
  * Make an explicit benefit statement
  * Give the audience a reason to listen.

Practice giving the presentation over and over and over again.
Video yourself. Make yourself sound less annoying. Use a mirror.
Assess yourself for:
Fillers, Inflection, Pace, Volume, Pauses, Enunciation, Tone, Vocabulary. 
Body language: Eye contact, facial expressions, hand gestures, posture and movement.
