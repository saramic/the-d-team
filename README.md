# The D Team

The D team for the [Melbourne 2017
Datathon](http://www.datasciencemelbourne.com/datathon/)

## Data analysis

First steps in analysing the data.

  - [ ] What does it represent?
  - [ ] what do the fields mean?
  
    **column meanings added for transactions files, there are some questions to be asked during hackday 2**
    
  - [ ] how do the fields vary?
  - [ ] what is the value we can deliver and to whom?
  
    * **Government**
      + information about how NHS subsidizing policies shape medication consumption
      + improve yearly reporting, their summaries are hard to digest https://www.pbs.gov.au/statistics/2014-2015-files/exp-prs-book-01-2014-15.pdf
      + interactive geospatial visualization and summary of medical spendings and seasonal patterns
      + disease trends
      + epidemic signals (daily data would give them even better predictive power)
      + drug oversuse
    * **Pharmacies**
      + how to predict the future consumption and stock properly, including data from NHS and seasonal trends
    * **Chain stores**
      + regions with high spending, finding good places for expanding business


## Questions and Answers

  - [x] What is the most popular drug by number of transactions?
    
    **Crestor**
    [analysis link](https://github.com/saramic/the-d-team/blob/master/analysis/Most_popular_drug.ipynb)

  - [x] What are the 10 most popular drugs?
    
    **CRESTOR, PANADOL OSTEO, LIPITOR, NEXIUM, COVERSYL, MICARDIS, SPIRIVA,
    NOTEN, ATACAND, SOMAC**
    [analysis link](https://github.com/saramic/the-d-team/blob/master/analysis/Most_popular_drug.ipynb)

  - [x] What is the trend of the 10 most popular drugs?

    **They are mostly in decline, some with very sharp drops (Crestor,
    Lipitor, Micardis), a few still growing(Panadol Osteo, Spiriva)**
    [analysis link](https://github.com/saramic/the-d-team/blob/master/analysis/Most_popular_drug.ipynb)

  - [ ] What are the 10 most popular drugs with regards to amount of daily doses sold?
  
  - [ ] What leads to sudden drops in some popular drugs?
    Possibly patents expiring, generics becoming available

  - [ ] Do many other drugs have sudden drops like Crestor, Lipitor, Micardis?
    what do they have in common?

  - [ ] Given that there is a general growth in useage, what is replacing the
    use of Crestor, Lipitor, Micardis?

    **Lipitor went out of patent Nov 2011 and by Jan 2012 70% of users switched
    onto generics**
    [initial analysis](analysis/Lipitor_replacement.ipynb)

    - [ ] who are the people who switched? by geo, by store, etc
    - [ ] what is the cost impact?
    - [ ] why is there no increase in useage?

  - [ ] In drug transactions over time, there is a peak every 3 months or so why?

  - [ ] In drug transactions over time, there is a peak in Dec and drop in Jan why?
    holidays? is it really so pronounced? ask a pharmacist?

  - [x] how many patients have an age?
    
    **only 6.8% - 37,809 out of 558,353**
    
  - [x] how many different postcodes to patients buy from?

    **35 for patient 109876 and only around half buy from 1**
    [analysis](analysis/Stores_per_patient.ipynb)

  - [ ] how far do patients buy from?
  
  - [x] what is the distribution of age?
    
    **Peak around 1945**
    [analysis link](https://github.com/saramic/the-d-team/blob/master/analysis/File_field_analysis.ipynb)

  - [ ] is there a correlation between something and the patients who have an
    age? pharamcy? drug? particular source system?

  - [ ] what areas do we have no patients for? by postcode? are there any significant areas?

  - [ ] what are some of the characteristics of source systems by drug? geography? etc...

  - [ ] what is the distribution of drug prices?

  - [ ] what is the distribution vs ATC other?

  - [ ] what is the patient distribution compared to geography? city vs country? vs real population?

  - [ ] what correlations exist in the data? correlate all vs all and cluster?

  - [x] what is the age distribution for various illnesses?
    
    **peaks seem different for Depression compared to others**
    [initial analysis](analysis/Illness_overview.ipynb)
    - [ ] normalize against spread of data per age
    - [ ] normalize against each other to compare peaks
    
   - [ ] Does using certain drugs predict development of additional illnesses in the future?
   
   - [ ] What can be expected about drugs popularity based on NHS subsidizing updates each year?

   - [x] how much money is being made per store?

    **up to $1.75M per year per store in Inner Regional Australia in NSW,
    interestingly there was a peak in 2012 and currently a decline**
    [analysis](analysis/Sales_per_store_by_region.ipynb)

   - [ ] Can we predict the specialisation of physicians (prescribers) based on their prescriptions?

   - [ ] Do prescribers exhibit brand loyalty when prescribing drugs?

   - [ ] Can we predict the approximate location/concentration of prescribers based on postcodes?

   - [ ] Can we predict the spread of viral/bacterial diseases (flu, cold, etc)?

   - [ ] are there any signs of epidemics where stores in a particular area
     have an exponential growthi in a particular drug?

## Questions

Suggested questions to ask (from the competition guidelines)

  - [ ] Are there any data quality issues?
  - [ ] Are there any demographic patterns in illnesses?
  - [ ] Which pharmacies have best patient loyalty; is loyalty age skewed?
  - [ ] Distribution of packet sizes (are larger pack sizes favoured, why?
        Does this change by geographical location?)
  - [ ] Are generic medicines favoured by any geographical location, age or gender?
  - [ ] Any explanation of the seasonal demand patterns?
  - [ ] Any specific seasonal patterns for particular drugs?
  - [ ] Any suspicious behavior in the data?
  - [ ] Can patients be clustered by drug usage patterns?
  - [ ] Any insights about where the trajectory of the health of Australia is heading?

## Questions for hackday 2
  - [ ] What happens to patient ID when patient moves to a new city (post code is assigned to patient ID)?   
  - [ ] What happens to store ID when a pharmacy owner changes/it joins or leaves a banner group?
  - [ ] What are the interpretations of the columns with to be confirmed status in Field Analysis file?

## Bad data

  - 1900 births
  - postcode in data wrong `1212	QLD	5615	1` should be 4615 for Qld
  - store `408	TAS	NULL	0` has no postcode
  - postcode in our data out of date

      SELECT 5090 AS postcode
      , 'Hope Valley' AS suburb
      , 'SA' AS state
      , 'NULL' AS dc
      , 'NULL' AS type
      , -34.847 AS lat
      , 138.699 AS lon
      , 0 AS regional_category
      , 'Metropolitan' AS regional_name

  - duplicate records???
  - 150 patients with an invalid postcode < 800, feels like the last number was
    dropped? is it regular like a page turn?
