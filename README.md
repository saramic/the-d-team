## Data analysis

First steps in analysing the data.

  - [ ] What does it represent?
  - [ ] what do the fields mean?
  - [ ] how do the fields vary?
  - [ ] what is the value we can deliver and to whom?

## Techniques

Techniques to try on the data - based on examples/samples from books etc.

  - [ ] Python/R notebooks
  - [ ] Deep Learning
    * based on examples from Deep Learning with Python - using Keras
      - [ ] binary classification - like classifying IMDB movie reviews
      - [ ] multi-class classification - like classifying newswires
      - [ ] regression - like predicting house prices
    * based on examples from ML with Tensor Flow
      - [ ] linear regression
      - [ ] classification
      - [ ] automatic clustering
      - [ ] hidden markov models
      - [ ] autoencoders
      - [ ] reinforcement learning
      - [ ] convolutional neural networks
    * based on fast.ai course
      - [ ] image classification
      - [ ] ...
  - [ ] Spark
    * based on examples from GraphX in action book
      - [ ] page rank
      - [ ] personalized page rank
      - [ ] connectedness through triangle count
      - [ ] shortest path
      - [ ] deriving taxonomies with MST
            text analysis done using Word2vec and googles news wire data set
    * based on examples from Spark in action book
      - [ ] MLlib classification and clustering
  - [ ] BigQuery - can we store data there? does this pipeline make sense
  - [ ] other
    - [ ] NLP
    - [ ] Taming Text book on text specific
    - [ ] Pentaho mondrial - Tableau like OLTP dashboard
    - [ ] Real World Machine Learning
    - [ ] solr, lucene, sphinx - search engines
  - [ ] processing
    - AWS
    - Google Data Proc
    - local laptop
    - Databricks cluster
    - other?
  - [ ] visualisation with React and D3.js
