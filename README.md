# The D Team

The D team for the [Melbourne 2017
Datathon](http://www.datasciencemelbourne.com/datathon/)

## Data analysis

First steps in analysing the data.

  - [ ] What does it represent?
  - [ ] what do the fields mean?
  - [ ] how do the fields vary?
  - [ ] what is the value we can deliver and to whom?

## Questions and Answers

  - [ ] What is the most popular drug by number of transactions?
    **Crestor**
    [analysis link](https://github.com/saramic/the-d-team/blob/master/analysis/Most_popular_drug.ipynb)

  - [ ] What are the 10 most popular drugs?
    **CRESTOR, PANADOL OSTEO, LIPITOR, NEXIUM, COVERSYL, MICARDIS, SPIRIVA,
    NOTEN, ATACAND, SOMAC**
    [analysis link](https://github.com/saramic/the-d-team/blob/master/analysis/Most_popular_drug.ipynb)

  - [ ] What is the trend of the 10 most popular drugs?
    **They are mostly in decline, some with very sharp drops (Crestor,
    Lipitor, Micardis), a few still growing(Panadol Osteo, Spiriva)**
    [analysis link](https://github.com/saramic/the-d-team/blob/master/analysis/Most_popular_drug.ipynb)

  - [ ] What leads to sudden drops in some popular drugs?

  - [ ] Do many other drugs have sudden drops like Crestor, Lipitor, Micardis?
    what do they have in common?

  - [ ] Given that there is a general growth in useage, what is replacing the
    use of Crestor, Lipitor, Micardis?

  - [ ] In drug transactions over time, there is a peak every 3 months or so why?

  - [ ] In drug transactions over time, there is a peak in Dec and drop in Jan why?
    holidays? is it really so pronounced? ask a pharmacist?

  - [ ] how many patients have an age?
    **only 6.8% - 37,809 out of 558,353**

  - [ ] what is the distribution of age?
    **Peak around 1945**
    [analysis link](https://github.com/saramic/the-d-team/blob/master/analysis/File_field_analysis.ipynb)

  - [ ] is there a correlation between something and the patients who have an
    age? pharamcy? drug? particular source system?

  - [ ] what areas do we have no patients for? by postcode? are there any significant areas?

  - [ ] what are some of the characteristics of source systems by drug? geography? etc...

  - [ ] what is the distribution of drug prices?

  - [ ] what is the distribution vs ATC other?

  - [ ] what is the patient distribution compared to geography? city vs country? vs real population?

  - [ ] what correlations exist in the data? correlate all vs all and cluster?

  - [ ] what is the age distribution for various illnesses?
    **peaks seem different for Depression compared to others**
    [initial analysis](analysis/Illness_overview.ipynb)
    - [ ] normalize against spread of data per age
    - [ ] normalize against each other to compare peaks

## Questions

Suggested questions to ask (from the competition guidelines)

  - [ ] Are there any data quality issues?
  - [ ] Are there any demographic patterns in illnesses?
  - [ ] Which pharmacies have best patient loyalty; is loyalty age skewed?
  - [ ] Distribution of packet sizes (are larger pack sizes favoured, why?
        Does this change by geographical location?)
  - [ ] Are generic medicines favoured by any geographical location, age or gender?
  - [ ] Any explanation of the seasonal demand patterns?
  - [ ] Any specific seasonal patterns for particular drugs?
  - [ ] Any suspicious behavior in the data?
  - [ ] Can patients be clustered by drug usage patterns?
  - [ ] Any insights about where the trajectory of the health of Australia is heading?

## Data sets

  * **Postcode geolocation**
    via http://www.corra.com.au/australian-postcode-location-data/ in
    http://www.corra.com.au/downloads/Australian_Post_Codes_Lat_Lon.zip
    alternative is to use http://v0.postcodeapi.com.au/

    **Postcode categorisation**
    http://mams.rmit.edu.au/gdn3pkz4qzna1.pdf
    * 1) Inner Regional Australia
